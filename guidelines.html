                <h1>I | PLACEMENT GUIDELINES</h1>
                <li>At the time of their creation, levels must be considered harder than the current 
                    hardest legitimately verified rated level on the list.<br></li>
                <li>The difficulty of a two-player level will be judged on their difficulty to complete 
                    solo.<br></li>
                <li>
                    Levels cannot be shorter than 30 seconds in the editor.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    A level needs to pass quality control to be placed on the list.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Revotes on levels are prohibited, unless the level gets major updates like 
                    deco changes, buffs that would move it at least 50 spots or extensions.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a level that’s harder than the current hardest rated level is verified, 
                    it skips quality control.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a level is found to be in violation of any of the List’s rules, it will be 
                    Marked for Removal. Levels that are Marked for Removal will have their entries 
                    on the List highlighted, and an explanation will be provided in the “Marked for 
                    Removal” section of the List. If the outstanding violations are not resolved 3 
                    days after being Marked, the level will be removed from the List.<br>
                    <i>&lt;1&gt; Classic levels will be placed based on their intended routes. Platformer 
                        placements will correspond to their easiest routes, including those with skips.</i><br>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <h1>II | QUALITY STANDARDS</h1>
                <li>
                    The quality of a level’s gameplay and decoration will be judged by the quality control
                    members on a case-by-case basis through a vote. A level needs 50% or more positive 
                    votes to pass and be added to the list. Some general guidelines used when judging 
                    the quality of a level are:
                    <ol type="a">
                         <li>
                            Levels determined to be low effort and/or created for the sole purpose of a list 
                            placement and considered to not have any distinctive or creative quality, will 
                            likely not be added to the list.
                         </li>
                         <li>
                            Levels 30 to 59 seconds long may be judged more harshly compared to longer levels.
                         </li>
                         <li>Levels highly relying on a popular gimmick, such as the “Nine Circles” style, 
                            should have some semblance of creativity or quality not found in the original level.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A level can have “old-style” decoration, but the decoration and gameplay should be 
                            suitable for the time period in which it is intended.
                            <ol type="i">
                                <li>
                                    Decoration quality standards increase the older the intended version is. Old style 
                                    levels should have some semblance of creativity, quality of execution or uniqueness 
                                    that sets them apart.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Exceptions to limited feature usage can be made, mostly in cases where it is tedious 
                                    or untenable to use said features, as long as they remain within the purview of update 
                                    capabilities. The following items (in this context) are generally permissible: layering,
                                    corner blocks, slabs, LBG, Player Color 1/2 and the usage of pulse triggers to replace 
                                    two colour triggers in rapid succession.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Levels in the List’s Top 10 may be judged with harsher standards. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If a level is a remake or buffed version of an existing level, it should be buffed 
                            in a transformative way and or have new or revamped decoration (e.g. Silent Clubstep 
                            by Maus999). 
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <strong>
                        While the above rules specifically are not hard set, they play a major part in the 
                        assessments of levels. They do not need to follow all of these, as long as they are 
                        deemed to be of overall good quality.
                    </strong><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    A level must be finished according to the creator to be placed on the List unless one of 
                    the following is true:
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>
                            The level was never finished and/or is considered to be forever unfinished 
                            (Battle of the Shades [Old Version] by GD Virus)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The differences between the unfinished and finished have significant parts that 
                            are different enough in gameplay and decoration (e.g. Yatagarasu [Old Version] 
                            by ViPriN)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The version is and unnerfed version or a version before the level underwent 
                            balancing by the final verifier (e.g. Unnerfed VR by KrampuX)
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <strong>
                        It’s important to note that these rules will mostly apply to levels more known 
                        in the overall community. Every level will still go through quality control.
                    </strong><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a level is significant to the List or impossible level history, exemptions from the 
                    Decoration and Gameplay Quality Standards rules can be made. The significance of each 
                    level will be judged on a case-by-case basis.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a list-eligible level (in its most current legitimately verified state) is or used to 
                    be rated, the level may be placed without regard to any of our quality standards / procedures.<br>

                <h1>III | PHYSICAL POSSIBILITY & OTHER LIMITATIONS</h1>
                <li>
                    Levels must be physically possible on at least one game-version and passable from beginning 
                    to end in normal mode on (at least) one frame-rate, to the exclusion of any external modifiers 
                    apart from FPS bypass.
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>
                            Changing the frame-rate during gameplay is not allowed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            All levels that are submitted to the List require their intended frame rate to be publicly 
                            stated. If an easier frame rate is later found it will replace the previous frame rate on 
                            the list. A level cannot require a frame-rate below 1.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If a level is verified, its listed frame-rate will be changed to the value used during 
                            verification.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the spirit of competition, triggers which count frames with the intent to force frame perfects 
                    are disallowed. This is due to the ease of creating extreme difficulty and overall low effort 
                    required in both playtesting and creating.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Timings that simulate randomness are allowed in levels. However, the level’s placement will be

                    World records must be attained legitimately by the standard of the Pointercrate Demon List; platformer records 
                    are held to the standard of the Platformer List.
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>
                            You may bypass to any frame rate greater than or equal to 1. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            World records using the noclip accuracy mod are allowed, as 
                            long as the accuracy upon completion is 100%
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    World records must not be achieved on “bug-fixed” or in any other way 
                    altered versions of a level
                </li>
                <li>Verifications or first completions of a level count as world records.</li>
                <h3>CLASSIC:</h3>
                <li>Levels without records have a stated minimum progress percentage.</li>
                <li>World records must closely follow the intended path, secret ways do not count.</li>
                <li>
                    Levels on the main list have their world records counted in increments of 0.1%, 
                    and levels on the extended list in increments of 1%.
                </li>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Some levels may have a lower percentage requirement depending on their nature.</li>
                    <li>Only the first player to attain a tied world record will be added to the List.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>
                    If your record was achieved using the “click between frames” mod, it may be accepted 
                    but will be marked in case this rule gets overwritten.
                </li>
                <h3>PLATFORMER:</h3>
                <li>
                    Progress is measured based on the amount of distance covered in relation to the level’s 
                    endpoint. World records will be judged (on these terms) on a case by case basis.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the case that a run is tied in distance, the faster run will take the world-record.
                </li>
                <h3>PLATFORMER TAS:</h3>
                <li>
                    For a world record TAS to be accepted, you must achieve a lower in-game time than the 
                    current record-holder.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Skips are allowed; if the creator does not want a certain skip in their level, they 
                    will need to fix it themselves.
                </li>
                <li>Your physics frame rate must be between 60 and 240.</li>
            </ol>
